Sys_keys now work but there is no distinction on left and right.

Disabling V-sync breaks vertical input.
When change the parameters in "Present" method from 1 to 0:
m_pSwapChain->Present(1u, 0u) --> m_pSwapChain->Present(0u, 0u)
vertical input from the mouse does not work anymore.

If we use the same model for 2 different gameobjects (using the scene graph),
all gameObject will take the transform and material of last updated object.

Sys_keys don't seem to work as intended.

Shader buffers, how can we fix them.

When minimizing the rended window, the app crashes
Changing camera's m_speed does not change its movement speed.

When change the parameters in "Present" method from 1 to 0:
m_pSwapChain->Present(1u, 0u) --> m_pSwapChain->Present(0u, 0u)
vertical input from the mouse does not work anymore.

If we use the same model for 2 different gameobjects (using the scene graph),
all gameObject will take the transform and material of last updated object.
